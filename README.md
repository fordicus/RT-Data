# High-Frequency Spot OrderBook and Chart Dataset

This repository manages high-frequency Level 2 (DOM) data 
from a major cryptocurrency spot exchange. The goal is to structure 
this data for use in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Transformer-based models 
to extract alpha signals from market microstructure dynamics.

---

## 🧭 Mission Summary

- Automate the download and organization of spot OrderBook tick data.
- Visualize snapshots and deltas via GUI.
- Generate datasets at fine timestamp resolutions (e.g., 10s or true tick).
- Build infrastructure for training RL and Transformer models:
  - Focus exclusively on order book data (exclude chart-based history).
  - Normalize time series to eliminate symbol dependency.
  - Use recent time frames to predict future movement likelihood.

## 📝 TODO

- [ ] Summarize the features, advantages, and limitations of Spot Chart and Order Book data, including their intended purpose.
- [ ] Fully understand the field structures and data schemas involved.
- [ ] Add relevant papers and video links that help explain the underlying concepts.

## 🔧 Code Structure

### `get_bybit_chart_dom.py` (🔒 Private)

This script automates the download of historical spot **chart data (executions)**
and **DOM snapshots (orderbook)** from ByBit public archives.

**It supports multi-day, multi-symbol batch retrieval via parallel curl executions**
and includes post-download validation to ensure data format integrity.
Configuration parameters (e.g., date range, trading pairs, max parallelism)
are specified in the external file `get_bybit_chart_dom.conf`.

> Please note: This script involves rate-sensitive infrastructure.
> Public sharing is deliberately restricted.

### `get_bybit_chart_dom_validated.py` (✅ Public)

A companion script to validate the integrity of previously downloaded `.csv.gz` and `.data.zip` files.
It performs full-format checks using parallel validation,
ensuring the data is safe to use for RL training or analysis.

This script is intended to be run **after** `get_bybit_chart_dom.py`
and does **not require internet access**.

## 🚀 Final Goal

Deliver a normalized, high-resolution dataset 
for training RL and Transformer models capable of 
predicting future market behavior from raw order book streams.
